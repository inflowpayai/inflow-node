# @inflowpayai/mpp

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#24](https://github.com/inflowpayai/inflow-node/pull/24)
  [`177e4c4`](https://github.com/inflowpayai/inflow-node/commit/177e4c4962613c43d111289fe8a8a28eaf068053) Thanks
  [@mnebliienko](https://github.com/mnebliienko)! - Add the Tempo MPP method end to end: the shared request/credential
  schemas and types in `@inflowpayai/mpp`, seller-side challenge minting in `@inflowpayai/mpp-seller`, and buyer-side
  fulfilment in `@inflowpayai/mpp-buyer`. Tempo settles on-chain via pull-mode credentials minted by the InFlow PSP;
  fee-payer sponsorship is opt-in via `methodDetails.feePayer` and defaults to off.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#19](https://github.com/inflowpayai/inflow-node/pull/19)
  [`9c18441`](https://github.com/inflowpayai/inflow-node/commit/9c18441acc9f69873c6a94690bb12d6672db5de5) Thanks
  [@nkavian](https://github.com/nkavian)! - Source the challenge `recipient` from the authenticated seller.
  `GET /v1/mpp/config` now returns the seller's `sellerId`, and the seller `inflow` method stamps it as the `recipient`
  on every minted challenge. Adds `sellerId` to the `MppConfigResponse` type (`@inflowpayai/mpp`) and removes the
  `recipient` option from `InflowSellerParameters` (`@inflowpayai/mpp-seller`) — the recipient is no longer
  caller-supplied. Fixes the server rejecting fulfilment with `invalid-challenge: "Recipient or sender is missing."`

  [`9c18441`](https://github.com/inflowpayai/inflow-node/commit/9c18441acc9f69873c6a94690bb12d6672db5de5) Thanks
  [@nkavian](https://github.com/nkavian)! - Remove the MPP protocol/SDK version gate. The server's `GET /v1/mpp/config`
  response no longer carries `protocolVersion` or `minSdkVersion`, so the SDK no longer reads or enforces them. Removed
  from `@inflowpayai/mpp`: the `MPP_PROTOCOL_VERSION` and `MPP_SDK_VERSION` constants, the `MppProtocolVersionError`
  error class, and the `protocolVersion`/`minSdkVersion` fields on the `MppConfigResponse` type.
  `@inflowpayai/mpp-seller` no longer re-exports `MppProtocolVersionError`, and `createConfigClient` no longer
  version-gates on load.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial release: the shared MPP definitions for InFlow's `inflow` payment method — the `inflow` `Method` namespace
  (defaulting to `charge`), the MPP wire types, the RFC 8785 JCS + base64url codec and `WWW-Authenticate: Payment`
  header render/parse, the InFlow MPP REST client, protocol constants, and typed errors.
